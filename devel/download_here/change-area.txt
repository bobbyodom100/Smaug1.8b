tr translates one character set into another, e,g. translate each of abcd
into ABCD, so a -> A, etc.

Use perl:

perl -pi~ -e 's/66(\d\d)/17\1/g' file.are

To substitute all sequences of 66 followed by two digits to 17 followed by
those two digits.

This will modify file.are but leave a backup in file.are~

-p - print each line in the file
-i~ - modify in place, leave backup in ~

-e - the whole script follows on command line

s/X/Y/Z substitute X whenever you see it with Y, using options Z

66(\d\d) - substitute 66 followed by two digits (\d\d) - the parens group
the two digits so perl will remember them

17\1 - substitute with 17 and the first parenthized thing in search
pattern, i.e. the last two digits

g - substitute globally, i.e. not just once on each line.


Go buy a Perl book. Preferrably one written by Larry Wall, so he can the
money he well deserves for writing Perl :)
