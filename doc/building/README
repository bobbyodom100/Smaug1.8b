        Thank you for chosing to build for Realms of Despair!
        -----------------------------------------------------

These files are here for you to use when building areas for our mud.
Please make sure your area doesn't use affects, or applies, or flags
that are not a part of our mud.  Areas that you may aquire and modify
are likely filled with codes ment for modified muds... as our mud is
highly modified... it has different spells, affects, applies.. etc
thank other muds, and than original Merc and Diku muds.  Please examine
all the files... especially aff.txt, and it is suggested that you print
them out.

          Guidelines for area themes.... *** IMPORTANT ***
          ------------------------------------------------

We want to slowly replace the old areas with new ones here on Realms
of Despair... and the new areas should fall into the following criteria:

 - Areas *MUST* fit into a medieval theme!
    - nothing futuristic or even close to modern day
    - nothing too silly or ridiculous or corny

 - Make sure mobiles are sufficiently difficult depending on the
   area's level range, and the equipment that the mobile is carrying.

 - Make sure precious items & keys are HELD/WORN, not carried by mobiles
   for TWO reasons:
      - non-held/worn items can be STOLEN
      - held/worn items can be damaged or destroyed

 - Make the area interesting and exciting to play...
      - secret doors...
      - traps, hidden objects, teleports
      - interesting extra descriptions
      - clues, hints etc...

 - We have mobprograms... (see mobprog.txt) which can be used to
   make your area much more interesting...
      - use them if you like... but do not OVER use them
        (ie: don't make too many!)

- We use ONLINE BUILDING.  Areas will not be taken in file form.
  Too much time and effort is wasted debugging mistakes in area
  files.  (Exceptions may be made for areas already debugged.)

              **** POST A NOTE FOR A VNUM ASSIGNMENT! ****

 A VNUM range will be provided for you to use for rooms, objects and
